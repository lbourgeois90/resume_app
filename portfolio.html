   <h3> Below is a collection of various pedagogical tools developed for secondary life science education. The student population that these tools were designed for is as follows:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li> Little to no prior knowledge</li>
      <li>English Language Learners with an average LEP 3</li>
      <li>District demographic of majority low-income</li>
      <li>District demographic of majority minority</li>

        <th>Grade Recovery Examples: Urban school districts struggle with attendance and student retention. To mitigate this problem, I designed a grade recovery system that focused on students completing entire unit packets that could be completed entirely at home without the aid of supplemental material. Therefore, students who missed extensive amount of classtime could gain the knowledge necessary to be able to demonstrate mastery of state standards without falling behind on current topics being discussed in class. Attached are examples of various tasks assigned in the grade recovery packets.</th>
