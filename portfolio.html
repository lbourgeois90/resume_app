   <p> Below is a collection of various pedagogical tools developed for secondary life science education. The student population that these tools were designed for is as follows:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li> Little to no prior knowledge</li>
      <li>English Language Learners with an average LEP 3</li>
      <li>District demographic of majority low-income</li>
      <li>District demographic of majority minority</li>
      </ul>

  <h3> What are Activators/Do Nows?</h3>
  <p> It is transition time and students are entering into the classroom. They continue to talk and meander around the room, essentially waiting for the teacher to call their attention to a specific task. Instead of waiting for a teacher to "tell" the students what they "should" be doing, it is a best practice to have a routine in place so students "know" what is expected upon entrance into the classroom. Activators and Do Nows are a great way to ensure this. For example, the routine may be for students to enter the room, sit in their assigned seats, take our their notebook and a pen/pencil... but then what? If given free time the students will just begin to socialize again. Do Nows or Activators are used to probe student thinking, whether it be a question that delves into prior knowledge or asks a student to recap the previous days lesson. Do Nows/Activators can be completed individually, can ask students to reflect and then discuss with a partner or can be a great way to ask an open-ended question that will then be discussed in group or the whole class.</p>
  <h4> Below are examples of Do Nows/Activators and are used to show the variation that this tool can serve in the opening on the lesson</h4>

  <td> In biology students are expected to be able to explain the various reactions that happen within cells such as transcription, cellular respiration or understanding the production and movement of proteins within cells. Even though biology standards have shifted to not explicitly "teach" the numerous structures found within a cell and to describe their function, this knowledge is essential in being able to master many of the outlined biology standards. This activator was printed, handed to students upon entry to the class, and was asked to be completed with a partner ("someone sitting next to you"). Directions for this were projected using an overhead slide. Students were designated 5 minutes to complete this task, which also included grabbing their notebook, getting seated and starting/finishing the task. Student-pairs were then cold-called to answer the questions as I filled out the correct ansewrs using a blank copy and projecting this on the ELMO. If a student-pair was unsure of the answer, they could "popcorn" to another pair to answer the question. This activator then lead into a lesson regarding the differentiation between photosynthesis and cellular respiration at the cell structure level.</td>

  <h3> What is Grade Recovery?</h3>
  <p> Urban school districts struggle with attendance and student retention. To mitigate this problem, I designed a grade recovery system that focused on students completing entire unit packets that could be completed entirely at home without the aid of supplemental material. Therefore, students who missed extensive amount of classtime could gain the knowledge necessary to be able to demonstrate mastery of state standards without falling behind on current topics being discussed in class. Attached are examples of various tasks assigned in the grade recovery packets.</p>
