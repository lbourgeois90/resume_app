   <p> Below is a collection of various pedagogical tools developed for secondary life science education. The student population that these tools were designed for is as follows:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li> Little to no prior knowledge</li>
      <li>English Language Learners with an average LEP 3</li>
      <li>District demographic of majority low-income</li>
      <li>District demographic of majority minority</li>
      </ul>

  <h2> Activators/ Do Nows</h4>

  <h3> What are Activators/Do Nows?</h3>
  <p> It is transition time and students are entering into the classroom. They continue to talk and meander around the room, essentially waiting for the teacher to call their attention to a specific task. Instead of waiting for a teacher to "tell" the students what they "should" be doing, it is a best practice to have a routine in place so students "know" what is expected upon entrance into the classroom. Activators and Do Nows are a great way to ensure this. For example, the routine may be for students to enter the room, sit in their assigned seats, take our their notebook and a pen/pencil... but then what? If given free time the students will just begin to socialize again. Do Nows or Activators are used to probe student thinking, whether it be a question that delves into prior knowledge or asks a student to recap the previous days lesson. Do Nows/Activators can be completed individually, can ask students to reflect and then discuss with a partner or can be a great way to ask an open-ended question that will then be discussed in group or the whole class.</p>
  <h4> Below are examples of Do Nows/Activators and are used to show the variation that this tool can serve in the opening on the lesson</h4>
